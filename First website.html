            <p style="font-size: larger;">I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation of dynamic web applications. Examples of web applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon.The good news is that learning web development is not that hard!In fact, many argue it’s the best form of coding for beginners to learn. It’s easy to set up, you get instant results and there’s plenty of online training available.A lot of people learn web coding because they want to create the next Facebook or find a job in the industry. But it’s also a good choice if you just want a general introduction to coding, since it’s super easy to get started. No matter whether you’re looking for a career or just want to learn coding, learning how to develop for the web is for you. It’s one of the smartest decisions you will ever make!</p>
